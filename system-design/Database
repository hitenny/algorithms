Replication 
  Leader-Follower
  Synchronous/Asynchronous

Replication Lag
  Read-after-write consistency - User who wrote reads from eleader to see what he wrote
  Monotonic reads - user always go to the same follower/replica to see consistent data
  Consistent-prefix reads - Data related to the same resource always go to the same partition so that all users see same order of data
  
Partitioning
  By Key range
  By hash key
  
  Scatter/Gather - Documents are indexed by key and then by secondary indexes within each partition. So all reads must be sent to all partitions and gathered.
  This results in tail-latency amplification
